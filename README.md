# Discord Terraria Bot

## Resum√©
As the name suggests, it's a bot created using [Discord's Python API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) intented to be a Discord built-in information wiki for every Terraria player. Its content is based on general item/NPC information and its respective crafting recipes, grab bag drops, enemy drops and selling offers from NPCs, as well as having some extra commands about rarity tiers and Angler quests.

## Dependencies
Discord Terraria Bot uses some specific Python libraries to work. In order to proceed with the setup, you may need to install some of them. 

### Linux
From the beggining, you may also need to install a Python package manager in order to proceed with the libraries installation if you don't have one already. Here we'll be using the awesomeness of PIP, which can be installed via
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
in any Ubuntu-based distribution.

All of the libraries can be installed using PIP running the following command from any Linux-based terminal
```bash
pip install discord.py levenshtein colorthief colormap
```

### Windows
Don't use Windows.
